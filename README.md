This repo is specifically desgined for my own personal development on different ML techniques using python. I may also add in some R projects as well. 
I am planning to do all of these with open source data, freely available data mostly found on kaggle or from the sklearn datasets. Plan to veture out to 
more datasets once these methods become more comfortable.
